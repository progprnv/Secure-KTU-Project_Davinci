**Bug Title**: Missing Content-Security-Policy (CSP) Header on `REDACTED`

---

**Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy (VRT)**:  
- Server Security Misconfiguration > Missing Security Headers > Content-Security-Policy

**Severity**:  
- P3 (Moderate severity due to potential for XSS and other injection attacks)

---

**Summary**:  
The domain `REDACTED` lacks a Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header. A properly implemented CSP can mitigate several types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), by specifying trusted sources for content. Without this header, the site is susceptible to injection attacks, such as XSS, increasing security risk.

---

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Visit the site `REDACTED`.
2. Open browser developer tools or use an online tool like SecurityHeaders.io.
3. Check for the presence of the Content-Security-Policy header.
4. Observe that the CSP header is missing.

---

**Expected Result**:  
The site should have a CSP header defining trusted sources for scripts, styles, and other resources, reducing the likelihood of script injection attacks.

---

**Actual Result**:  
The Content-Security-Policy header is missing, increasing the risk of XSS and other injection attacks.

---

**Recommendation**:

1. Implement a Content-Security-Policy header to restrict the sources from which scripts, styles, and other resources can be loaded.
   
   Example CSP configuration:
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; object-src 'none';
   ```

2. Test and adjust the CSP policy to ensure legitimate functionality while minimizing risks.

---

**Impact**:  
The lack of a CSP header leaves the website more vulnerable to XSS and other script injection attacks, which can compromise user data and site integrity.
