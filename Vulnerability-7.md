# Bug Title: Missing Content-Security-Policy (CSP) Header
# Endpoint: [REDACTED]
## Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy (VRT):
# Server Security Misconfiguration > Missing Security Headers > Content-Security-Policy

## Severity:
# P3 (Moderate severity due to the potential for XSS and other injection attacks)

## Summary:
The domain ktu.edu.in is missing the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header. A proper CSP can prevent many types of attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), by whitelisting trusted content sources. Without this header, the site is vulnerable to malicious scripts being injected and executed, posing a security risk.

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the site [REDACTED].
2. Use browser developer tools or an online tool like SecurityHeaders.io to check the presence of the Content-Security-Policy header.
3. Observe that the header is not set.

## Expected Result:
The site should have a Content-Security-Policy header that defines trusted sources for scripts, styles, and other resources.

## Actual Result:
The Content-Security-Policy header is missing, allowing potential XSS attacks.

## Recommendation:
Add a Content-Security-Policy header to mitigate XSS and other script injection attacks. Example:
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; object-src 'none';

## Impact:
Without a CSP, the website is more vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other attacks that involve injecting malicious code.
