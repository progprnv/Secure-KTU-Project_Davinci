**Bug Title**: Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header on `REDACTED`

---

**Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy (VRT)**:  
- Server Security Misconfiguration > Missing Security Headers > X-Content-Type-Options

**Severity**:  
- P4 (Low severity due to potential MIME-type sniffing vulnerabilities)

---

**Summary**:  
The X-Content-Type-Options header is absent on the domain `REDACTED`. This header ensures that browsers adhere to the declared content types rather than attempting to "sniff" the MIME type, which can prevent certain attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if a browser incorrectly interprets the content type.

---

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Visit the site `REDACTED`.
2. Open the developer tools or use an online scanner like SecurityHeaders.io.
3. Check for the X-Content-Type-Options header and observe that it is missing.

---

**Expected Result**:  
The X-Content-Type-Options header should be set to "nosniff" to prevent MIME-type sniffing.

---

**Actual Result**:  
The X-Content-Type-Options header is missing, allowing potential MIME-type sniffing by browsers.

---

**Recommendation**:

1. Add the following header to the server response:
   ```
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   ```

2. Verify that the header is consistently applied across responses to protect against MIME-type sniffing vulnerabilities.

---

**Impact**:  
Without this header, browsers may attempt MIME-type sniffing, potentially misinterpreting content and opening up XSS or injection-based attack vectors.
