**Bug Title**: No Spoofing Protection on Email Domain for `REDACTED`

---

**Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy (VRT)**:  
- Server Security Misconfiguration > Mail Server Misconfiguration > No Spoofing Protection on Email Domain

**Severity**:  
- P3 (Can vary depending on program guidelines, possibly P4)

---

**Summary**:  
The email domain `REDACTED` does not have proper email spoofing protection due to the absence of a DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) record. Without this record, attackers can spoof emails that appear to come from `REDACTED`, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities where the victim believes they are communicating with legitimate senders from this domain.

---

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Use an email spoofing tool or service that allows sending emails from arbitrary addresses.
2. Set the `From` address as any valid-looking email from the `REDACTED.in` domain, e.g., `user@REDACTED.IN`.
3. Send the email to a target inbox.
4. Observe that the email successfully arrives in the inbox without being flagged as suspicious.

---

**Expected Result**:  
The domain `REDACTED` should have a DMARC record in place, preventing the spoofed email from being delivered or marking it as suspicious or spam.

---

**Actual Result**:  
The domain lacks a DMARC record, allowing spoofed emails to be sent and received without any warning, thus leading to a significant security risk.

---

**Technical Details**:

- **Domain**: `REDACTED`
- **DMARC Record**: No DMARC record found (verified through external tools such as MXToolbox).
- **SPF and DKIM**: While the domain might have SPF and DKIM records, the lack of a DMARC policy allows for emails to bypass these controls without enforcement or reporting.

---

**Recommendation**:

1. Publish a DMARC record for `REDACTED`. The recommended configuration is to start with a monitoring policy (`p=none`) and gradually move towards a stricter policy (`p=reject`) to prevent spoofing.
   
   Example of a basic DMARC record:
   ```
   v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@REDACTED.in; ruf=mailto:dmarc-failures@REDACTED.in; fo=1
   ```

2. Review and test the domainâ€™s email configuration after implementing DMARC to ensure legitimate emails are not blocked and that spoofed emails are properly rejected.

---

**Impact**:  
Due to the absence of DMARC protection, attackers can easily spoof emails from the `REDACTED.IN` domain, leading to phishing attacks, impersonation, and loss of trust in the domain's communications.
