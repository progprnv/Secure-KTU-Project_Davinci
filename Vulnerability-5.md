### Vulnerability Assessment Report

**Vulnerability Type**: CSRF Token Exposure  
**Endpoint**: [REDACTED]

---

#### Description:
During the assessment of the endpoint responsible for password resets, it was discovered that the application exposes the CSRF token in the response body upon submitting a username and email ID for a password reset request. The presence of the CSRF token in the response body can pose a security risk, potentially leading to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

#### Details:
1. **CSRF Token Exposure**:
   - When a user submits their username and email ID for the password reset, the server responds with a body containing the CSRF token.
   - The CSRF token is meant to protect against unauthorized actions by ensuring that requests are valid and originated from the authenticated user.
   - Exposing this token in the response makes it accessible to potential attackers, especially if they can exploit other vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS) to obtain the token.

2. **Potential Impact**:
   - An attacker could use the exposed CSRF token in combination with a forged request to perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent.
   - This could lead to unauthorized password resets or other sensitive operations, compromising user accounts and personal information.

3. **Recommendations**:
   - **Restrict Token Exposure**: Ensure that CSRF tokens are only included in responses where absolutely necessary and are not leaked to untrusted sources.
   - **Token Validation**: Implement proper server-side validation of CSRF tokens to ensure they are checked against the user's session and are tied to specific actions.
   - **Token Rotation**: Consider rotating CSRF tokens for each session or critical action to reduce the risk of exploitation.
   - **Security Best Practices**: Employ security measures such as Content Security Policy (CSP) and input validation to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks, which could lead to CSRF token theft.

#### Conclusion:
The exposure of the CSRF token in the password reset response is a security concern that should be addressed promptly to maintain the integrity of user accounts and protect against potential CSRF attacks. Immediate attention is recommended to secure the endpoint and implement the necessary safeguards.
