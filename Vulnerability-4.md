## 1. Vulnerability Summary

- **Vulnerability**: Server Information Disclosure
- **Exposed Server Version**: [REDACTED-SERVICE]
- **Potential Vulnerability**: Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability (CVE-2023-[REDACTED])
- **Severity**: Medium (Information Disclosure), High (Due to associated CVE)

---

## 2. Vulnerability Description

The endpoint [REDACTED] discloses the server information, including the version. Disclosing server version information can allow attackers to identify vulnerabilities associated with that specific version.

In this case, the server is known to be vulnerable to **CVE-2023-REDACTED**, which could allow an attacker to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exploiting the file upload functionality without proper restrictions. This makes the server potentially vulnerable to exploitation if no mitigation steps have been taken.

---

## 3. Impact

- **Information Disclosure**: The server version disclosure itself doesn't cause direct harm but provides critical information to attackers that can be used to find known vulnerabilities for exploitation.
  
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Since the server is vulnerable to **CVE-2023-REDACTED**, attackers could exploit this to overload the server, causing service disruption.

---

## 4. Risk Level

- **Information Disclosure Risk**: Medium
- **CVE-2023-REDACTED Risk**: High

---

## 5. Proof of Concept (PoC)

During the assessment, the following information was observed in the response headers from the endpoint `[REDACTED]`:

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Server: {Server name/version number}
```

This server version disclosure reveals the server is running an outdated and vulnerable version of an outdated server, specifically version X.X.XX, which is impacted by **CVE-2023-REDACTED**.

---

## 6. Mitigation Recommendations

1. **Update the software**: 
   - Upgrade to the latest version of Apache Tomcat to mitigate **CVE-2023-REDACTED** and other known vulnerabilities.
   
2. **Hide Server Information**:
   - Configure Apache Tomcat to prevent the disclosure of server information in HTTP response headers. You can modify the `server.xml` configuration file and set the `server` attribute to an empty value:
     ```xml
     <Connector ... server=""/>
     ```

3. **Disable Unnecessary Endpoints**:
   - Disable or remove access to unnecessary endpoints, which expose sensitive information about the server environment.

4. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Implement security headers such as `X-Content-Type-Options` and `X-XSS-Protection`.
   - Regularly audit the server for misconfigurations and ensure sensitive information is not unnecessarily exposed.

---

## 7. Conclusion

A particular endpoint exposes server version details, which could allow attackers to identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the disclosed version of [REDACTED SOFTWARE]. This version is susceptible to a critical Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability (CVE-2023-[REDACTED]). Immediate action should be taken to hide server details and update the software to prevent potential exploitation.
This version emphasizes the exposure of server information and highlights the risk associated with the disclosed version and it can affect the main domain.
