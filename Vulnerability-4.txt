## 1. Vulnerability Summary

- **Vulnerability**: Server Information Disclosure
- **Exposed Server Version**: Apache Tomcat/9.0.71
- **Potential Vulnerability**: Apache Tomcat Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability (CVE-2023-24998)
- **Severity**: Medium (Information Disclosure), High (Due to associated CVE)

---

## 2. Vulnerability Description

The endpoint `https://REDACTED/examples/jsp/snp/example` discloses the server information, including the version of Apache Tomcat being used (`Apache Tomcat/9.0.71`). Disclosing server version information can allow attackers to identify vulnerabilities associated with that specific version.

In this case, Apache Tomcat version 9.0.71 is known to be vulnerable to **CVE-2023-24998**, which could allow an attacker to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exploiting the file upload functionality without proper restrictions. This makes the server potentially vulnerable to exploitation if no mitigation steps have been taken.

---

## 3. Impact

- **Information Disclosure**: The server version disclosure itself doesn't cause direct harm but provides critical information to attackers that can be used to find known vulnerabilities for exploitation.
  
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Since Apache Tomcat 9.0.71 is vulnerable to **CVE-2023-24998**, attackers could exploit this to overload the server, causing service disruption.

---

## 4. Risk Level

- **Information Disclosure Risk**: Medium
- **CVE-2023-24998 Risk**: High

The risk is high primarily because Apache Tomcat version 9.0.71 contains a well-documented vulnerability, CVE-2023-24998. The disclosed server version directly aids in identifying this vulnerability.

---

## 5. Proof of Concept (PoC)

During the assessment, the following information was observed in the response headers from the endpoint `/examples/jsp/snp/example`:

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Server: Apache Tomcat/9.0.71
```

This server version disclosure reveals the server is running an outdated and vulnerable version of Apache Tomcat, specifically version 9.0.71, which is impacted by **CVE-2023-24998**.

---

## 6. Mitigation Recommendations

1. **Update Apache Tomcat**: 
   - Upgrade to the latest version of Apache Tomcat to mitigate **CVE-2023-24998** and other known vulnerabilities.
   
2. **Hide Server Information**:
   - Configure Apache Tomcat to prevent the disclosure of server information in HTTP response headers. You can modify the `server.xml` configuration file and set the `server` attribute to an empty value:
     ```xml
     <Connector ... server=""/>
     ```

3. **Disable Unnecessary Endpoints**:
   - Disable or remove access to unnecessary endpoints like `/examples/jsp/snp/`, which expose sensitive information about the server environment.

4. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Implement security headers such as `X-Content-Type-Options` and `X-XSS-Protection`.
   - Regularly audit the server for misconfigurations and ensure sensitive information is not unnecessarily exposed.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The endpoint at `https://REDACTED/examples/jsp/snp/example` exposes server version details, which could allow attackers to identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the disclosed version of Apache Tomcat (9.0.71). This version is susceptible to a critical Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability (CVE-2023-24998). Immediate action should be taken to hide server details and update the software to prevent potential exploitation.
This version emphasizes the exposure of server information and highlights the risk associated with the disclosed version and it can affect the main domain.
